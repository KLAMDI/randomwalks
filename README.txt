# Polymers and Random Walks

This Python program simulates a random walk to describe polymer behaviour in a solvent. 
A polymer is a one-dimensional chain that consists of smaller bonded monemer molecules.

The goal is to simulate a random walk description of a gene and to investigate its end-to-end distance.
Afterwards, a self-avoiding random walk is simulated and the radius of gyration, end-to-end distance
and connectivity constant are calculated for it. Finally, the results from both types are compared.
